# Integral inner product

Creates `%i%` infix operator for calculating the integral inner product of two vectors from a inner product space over **R**<sup>n</sup>, using only base R. Also provides impementation of the Gram-Schmidt process, incorporating the integral inner product, for generating an orthonormal set of vectors.

## Test examples
